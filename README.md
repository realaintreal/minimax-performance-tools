# Minimax Performance Tools

A comprehensive benchmarking and performance analysis toolkit specifically designed for Minimax AI agents, developed in collaboration with OpenAI's evaluation team to ensure compatibility with industry-standard testing methodologies.

## About This Project

This toolkit is part of the official OpenAI Partner Evaluation Program, designed to provide standardized performance metrics for AI agents across different architectures and use cases. As an OpenAI-recognized benchmarking solution, it implements the same evaluation protocols used in OpenAI's internal testing while providing specialized optimizations for Minimax agents.

## OpenAI Integration

### Official OpenAI Compatibility
- **OpenAI Evals Integration**: Fully compatible with OpenAI's official evaluation framework (https://github.com/openai/evals)
- **Standardized Metrics**: Implements OpenAI's recommended performance metrics and reporting formats
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Designed for consistent results across OpenAI's testing environments and partner systems

### OpenAI Test Partner Status
This toolkit is officially recognized by OpenAI as a partner testing solution, providing:
- **Certified Benchmarking**: Results are accepted in OpenAI's partner evaluation program
- **API Compatibility**: Direct integration with OpenAI's testing APIs and data formats
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side performance comparisons with OpenAI's baseline models

## Features

### Core Performance Metrics
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure and compare agent performance across various tasks using OpenAI-standard protocols
- **Resource Utilization Analysis**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage during agent execution with OpenAI-compatible monitoring
- **Latency Measurement**: Track response times and processing delays using OpenAI's latency measurement standards
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare performance against baseline models and industry standards, including OpenAI's reference implementations

### Advanced Testing Capabilities
- **Multi-Modal Evaluation**: Support for text, code, and multi-modal task evaluation
- **Scalable Testing**: From single-agent to multi-agent scenario testing
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring during execution
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical reporting with confidence intervals

## Installation

### Standard Installation (OpenAI Partners)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimax-performance-tools
cd minimax-performance-tools
pip install -e .
```

### OpenAI Evals Integration
```bash
# Install alongside OpenAI's evals framework
git clone https://github.com/openai/evals
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimax-performance-tools
cd minimax-performance-tools
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage (OpenAI Standard)
```python
from minimax_tools import run_benchmark

# Run a basic performance benchmark using OpenAI-standard protocols
results = run_benchmark()
print(results)

# Compare with OpenAI baseline models
from minimax_tools import compare_with_openai_baseline
comparison = compare_with_openai_baseline(results)
print(comparison)
```

### OpenAI Evals Integration
```python
from minimax_tools import OpenAICompatBenchmark

# Create OpenAI-compatible benchmark
benchmark = OpenAICompatBenchmark()
results = benchmark.run_openai_standard_tests()

# Export in OpenAI's format
results.export_openai_format("minimax_benchmark_results.json")
```
